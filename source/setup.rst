* You need vagrant install from `here <https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads>`_

* Get the Vagrant virtual machine that we'll use to work on from `Github <https://github.com/pynashorg/pynash-cnc>`_

        git clone git@github.com:pynashorg/pynash-cnc.git

* Next we need to download and start the vagrant box (this will take a while the first time because it has to download an ubuntu cloud image)

        vagrant up

* You're ready to go shutdown the vagrant box and cya Saturday morning!

        vagrant halt
